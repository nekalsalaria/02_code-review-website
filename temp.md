❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will lead to an error because `a` and
`b` are not in scope.
* ❌ The function does not accept any arguments. This limits its reusability, as it can only sum predefined (or global)
`a` and `b`.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making the function reusable.
* ✔ Returns the sum of `a` and `b`. The variables are now properly scoped within the function.

Final Note:

Always define your variables. In Javascript, without `let`, `const`, or `var`, the variables will be implicitly declared
in the global scope, which is generally bad practice. The arguments passed to the function make it much more versatile
and predictable.
